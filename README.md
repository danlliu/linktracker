## About

linktracker is a web app that keeps track of meeting links so you don't have to. Just enter your meeting title, link
, password (if it has one), and date/time, and it will keep track of that. You can filter your links by upcoming
 (within 24 hours), today (all events for today regardless of time), and starred.
 
linktracker was developed with HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap, and Vue.js.
